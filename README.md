# Image Palette Generator 

An image palette generator is a tool that can analyze an image and extract its dominant colors to create a color palette. This palette can then be used for website design, graphic design, and other visual arts, to create a consistent and appealing color scheme based on a specific image. 

The program we're going to make today will extract the most dominant colors in an image, show what these colors look like, and print out the RGB and HEX values. So why use a paid service or website to access this, when you can just code it yourself, in Python? Let's get started!
